# Obsidian Compatibility Test

## 1. GitHub Supported Alerts
These should render as colored boxes with icons:

> [!NOTE]
> This is a standard note. It should look blue on GitHub.

> [!TIP]
> This is a tip. It should look green.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is important! It should look purple.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a warning. It should look yellow/orange.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a caution. It should look red.

---

## 2. Obsidian Specific Callouts
These are valid in Obsidian but **not** standard in GitHub. They will likely look like plain quotes:

> [!todo]
> This is a to-do item. In Obsidian, this is blue. Here, it is likely a generic quote.

> [!bug]
> This represents a bug.

---

## 3. Link Syntax
**Standard Markdown:**
[Click here to go to the readme](README.md) <--- This should work.

**Obsidian Wikilink:**
[[README]] <--- This will likely appear as plain text or a broken link.
